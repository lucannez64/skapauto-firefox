# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Manifest V3 Migration & Permission Hardening
- **Issue**: Extension was using deprecated Manifest V2 with overly broad permissions
- **Fix**: Upgraded to Manifest V3 with restricted permissions
- **Changes**:
  - Removed unnecessary `tabs` and `cookies` permissions
  - Restricted content script injection to specific trusted domains only
  - Strengthened Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Migrated from `browser_action` to `action`
  - Updated background script to service worker model

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- **Issue**: Use of `innerHTML` for setting icon content could lead to XSS
- **Fix**: Replaced `innerHTML` with `textContent` for safe content insertion
- **Location**: `src/content.ts` line 569

### 3. Message Passing Security
- **Issue**: No origin validation for inter-component messages
- **Fix**: Added sender validation to prevent unauthorized message handling
- **Changes**:
  - Background script now validates message sender ID
  - Content script validates message origin
  - Unauthorized messages are rejected and logged

### 4. Secure Storage Hardening
- **Issue**: Insufficient input validation and payload integrity checks
- **Fix**: Enhanced secure storage with comprehensive validation
- **Changes**:
  - Added input parameter validation
  - Implemented payload integrity verification
  - Added JSON size limits to prevent DoS attacks
  - Enhanced error handling and cleanup

### 5. Content Script Injection Scope
- **Issue**: Content scripts were injected on all HTTP/HTTPS sites
- **Fix**: Restricted injection to specific trusted domains only
- **Domains**: Limited to Skap, PayPal, Salesforce, Reddit, and Discord

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Removed unnecessary permissions
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are now validated
3. **Origin Validation**: All message passing includes sender verification
4. **Content Security Policy**: Strengthened CSP with `object-src 'none'`
5. **Safe DOM Manipulation**: Eliminated unsafe HTML insertion methods

## Password Manager Specific Protections

These fixes address common vulnerabilities that have affected password managers:
- Prevented unauthorized access to stored credentials
- Eliminated potential for credential injection attacks
- Secured inter-component communication channels
- Restricted extension scope to minimize attack surface

## Version Update
Extension version bumped to 1.0.5 to reflect security improvements.
